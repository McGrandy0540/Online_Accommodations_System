# Registration and Login Flow Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes implemented to correct the registration flow logic and add subscription validation to the login process.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration Flow Issue
**Problem**: User data was being saved to the database BEFORE OTP verification and subscription payment.

**Solution**: Implemented correct flow:
- **For Students**: Form Submission → OTP Verification → Save to Database → Subscription Payment → Complete Registration
- **For Property Owners/Admins**: Form Submission → OTP Verification → Save to Database → Complete Registration

### 2. Login Subscription Validation
**Problem**: No validation for expired student subscriptions during login.

**Solution**: Added subscription check for students during login:
- Check subscription status for student users
- If expired or missing, show renewal payment form (GHS 20)
- Integrate Paystack for subscription renewal
- Only allow login after successful subscription renewal

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `auth/register_new.php` - Fixed registration flow
2. `auth/login_new.php` - Login with subscription validation

### Key Changes Made:

#### Registration Flow (`auth/register_new.php`):
- **Step 1**: User fills form and clicks "Send OTP"
- **Step 2**: OTP verification required before proceeding
- **Step 3**: Only after OTP verification, user data is saved to database
- **Step 4**: For students, subscription payment is required after database save
- **Step 5**: Registration complete only after all steps

#### Login Flow (`auth/login_new.php`):
- **Standard Login**: Email/password validation
- **Student Subscription Check**: 
  - Check if student has active subscription
  - If expired/missing, show renewal form
  - Integrate Paystack for GHS 20 renewal payment
  - Complete login only after successful renewal

## Technical Implementation

### Registration Flow Logic:
```php
// OLD FLOW (INCORRECT):
// Form Submit → Save to DB → OTP → Subscription → Complete

// NEW FLOW (CORRECT):
// Form Submit → OTP Verification → Save to DB → Subscription (students) → Complete
```

### Login Subscription Check:
```php
if ($user['status'] === 'student') {
    $subscriptionStatus = $subscriptionService->getUserSubscriptionStatus($user['id']);
    
    if (!$subscriptionStatus['has_subscription'] || $subscriptionStatus['status'] === 'expired') {
        // Show renewal form with Paystack integration
        $subscriptionExpired = true;
    } else {
        // Proceed with login
        completeLogin($user, $email);
    }
}
```

3. **Database Migration**: Ensure all required tables exist
4. **Payment Gateway**: Verify Paystack configuration
5. **SMS Service**: Ensure OTP service is working

## Support and Maintenance

### Common Issues:
